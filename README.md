Many students claim not to like math. But for some, the issue with math is more than simply disliking algebra or fractions. For some students, doing math can cause negative emotions like fear of failure. This harms their ability to perform.  This is called ‘MATH ANXIETY’.

## EFFECTS OF MATH ANXIETY IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS

Math anxiety impacts students as early as the first grade by affecting their working memory. Working memory is like a ‘mental scratchpad’. It is important when we need to keep track of numbers. But this working memory can be disrupted by math anxiety in both elementary and secondary school students. This can lead students with math anxiety to be as much as half a school year behind their peers in math. Even for students who don’t struggle with math anxiety, it’s important to develop positive study habits that will help them as math becomes more complex.

## WHAT CAUSES MATH ANXIETY?

Major causes of math anxiety include:

- ### The pressure caused by time limits on tests

The deadlines that timed tests impose on students lead them to feel anxious. This leads them to forget concepts that they have no problem remembering at home. Since these tests can have a negative impact on grades, the student’s fear of failure is confirmed. This creates a vicious circle that can be difficult to break.

The fear of public embarrassment

Math anxiety has also been linked to negative emotions from the past. If a student has been scolded for getting an answer wrong, it can make his or her anxiety worse. The same is true if he or she has been embarrassed in front of others.

Influence of teachers

Students can also pick up on their teacher’s feelings about math. If a teacher is excited and positive about math, the students will be as well. But if educators are negative about it, it can have the opposite effect.
